**Learning:** Found multiple instances where form labels were visually placed next to inputs but lacked semantic connection via `htmlFor` and `id` attributes. This breaks screen reader support and reduces the clickable hit area for inputs, especially impacting mobile users.
**Action:** Always ensure `<label>` tags use `htmlFor` mapping to the input's `id` to guarantee programmatic association and better UX.
